		<h2>What NYC's Buses Contribute To The MTA</h2>
		<!--Create a div to hold my text-->
		<div id ="textDiv">
			<p>Of the various agencies operated by the MTA, buses put the greatest strain on the organization's finances.  
			They contribute around 30% of ridership and a little over 34% of operating expenses.
			However, their contribution to fare revenues has never exceeded 24%, and has been consistently decreasing over the past four years. As a matter of fact, so has ridership.</p>
			
			<p> The sudden increase, in 2006, of all three metrics listed below is due to the establishment of the MTA Bus Company. Separate from the New York City Transit bus agency, it was created in 2004 when the MTA took over several lines in Brooklyn and The Bronx that had hitherto been run by private companies. 
			However, while the initial spikes in ridership and fare revenues resulting from this move have gradually tapered off, the operating expenses have remained almost the same.</p>
